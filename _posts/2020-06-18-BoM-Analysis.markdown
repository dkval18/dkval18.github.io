# The Book of Mormon as a Data Scientist
Have you ever heard of the [Book of Mormon][bom-info]? It is part of the foundational scripture set of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  But why?  What does it contain? Reading the [Book of Mormon][bom-read] is the best way to find out.  

As a data scientist I have learned how to study text in a different way. Computers, along with developments in natural language processing allows me to study this sacred text in a different way. I want to share my analysis in depth and share what I have learned.  Hopefully you will better understand what is in the [Book of Mormon, Another Testatment of Jesus Christ][bom-info] and get a glimpse into how a data scientist thinks about text analytics.
