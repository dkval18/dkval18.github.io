In a information abundant world, its easy to accept the any information as
truth.  Posts, news, and other media drive emotional responses for more clicks
or shares. As an engineer, I have learned to ask questions.  Questions like
why, how, or show me. Trust but verify is a common phrase where I work.  You 
can trust someone, but verify for yourself. I have learned to use
Data Science and computers to do my own analysis. Here I want to share with
you how I see.  But I expect the same from you, Trust but verify!
