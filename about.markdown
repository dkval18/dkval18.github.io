In an information abundant world, its easy to accept the any information as
truth.  Posts, news, and other media drive *emotional responses* for more clicks
or shares. My professional career has taught me to **ask questions**; to not simply accept
the first information I hear. When something sounds shocking or unbelievable, **question, dig and research**.
When I don't understand another's point of view, **ask questions**.  Questions drive answers,
and questions drive solutions. In the search of answering questions, I use 
data science and computer programming to find answers. And once I do, I want to
share my viewpoint with you. Come with me as we ask questions and find
answers based on the data around us.  No quick answers, no easy way out.


The opinions I offer are my own, and based on my own analysis. They don't 
reflect the viewpoint of my employer, religion, community or family.  Thanks
for hopping on to explore the world from this analytical point of view.
